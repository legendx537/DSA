In this Module, we will be looking at different types of searches :-

  1. Linear search :-
       - Loop through the array and check if the current element is equal to the value
       - If the value is equal then return the index at which the element is found
       - return -1 if the element is not found

  2. Binary Search :-
       - Binary search is much faster than the linear search.
       - Half of the remaining element can be eliminated at a time, instead of eliminating them one by one.
       - Binary search works on sorted array only.

       - we create two pointer left at the start of the array and right at the end of the array
       - Based on left and write pointer , we calculate middle pointer
       - if the middle is equal to the value , then we return that index;
       - if the middle is greater than the value then we move the right pointer down
       - if the middle pointer is less than the value then move the left pointer up.
       - if the value is never found then we return -1
