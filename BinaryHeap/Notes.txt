A Binary Heap is binary Tree with the following properties :-

  * A binary Heap is either Max Binary Heap  or Min Binary heap
  * Min Binary Heap :- root node has the minimum value
  * Max Binary heap :- root node has the maximum value
  * It is complete binary Tree. all teh level are filled and the last level has nodes as left as possible.


  Common Operation in Binary Heap :-

    * Creation of a binary Heap
    * Peek top of Binary Heap
    * Extract Min / Extract Max
    * Traversal of Binary Heap
    *  Size of Binary Heap
    * Insert value in Binary Heap
    * Delete the entire binary Heap

 For Implementing Binary Heap , we have

    * Array Implementation
    * Reference or point Implementation


  Traversals :-
     PreOrder traversal of binary heap is same as Preorder traversal of Binary tree using array
     InOrder traversal of binary heap is same as InOrder traversal of Binary tree using array
     PostOrder traversal of binary heap is same as PostOrder traversal of Binary tree using array
     LevelOrder traversal of binary heap is same as LevelOrder traversal of Binary tree using array

     So for the binary heap we will be only implementing the level Order Traversal.
