A Binary Heap is binary Tree with the following properties :-

  * A binary Heap is either Max Binary Heap  or Min Binary heap
  * Min Binary Heap :- root node has the minimum value
  * Max Binary heap :- root node has the maximum value
  * It is complete binary Tree. all teh level are filled and the last level has nodes as left as possible.


  Common Operation in Binary Heap :-

    * Creation of a binary Heap
    * Peek top of Binary Heap
    * Extract Min / Extract Max
    * Traversal of Binary Heap
    *  Size of Binary Heap
    * Insert value in Binary Heap
    * Delete the entire binary Heap
