There can be three cases when we delete a node :-

  1 Node is leaf node
  2 Node has one child
  3 Node has two child

  for 1 :-
   we have to search the node
   then directly we can delete the node means set it to null

  for 2 :-
    we have to search the node with one child
    then we have to replace parent node value with the child node value
    then we have to delete the child node

  for 3 :-
    we have to find the node to be deleted
    then we have to find the successor of that node (Successor is the smallest node in the right subtree) :-
    (Remember :- minimum node of the right subtree will be present in the left subtree of  right subtree we are searching for)
    we need to delete the value of node to be deleted with the successor value
    then we have to delete the successor by the delete method on the right subtree with the successor node value
